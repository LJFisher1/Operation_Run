# Operation Run

## Introduction
**Operation Run** is a fantasy first-person shooter (FPS) with puzzle-like levels. In this game, you play as a powerful wizard navigating through various environments filled with dangerous creatures, traps, and challenges. Your goal is to defeat enemies, collect magical gems, and escape each level while managing health and mana.

- **Traps and Hazards**: Avoid deadly traps that can kill you, adding layers of challenge to each level.
- **Score System**: Earn points for completing levels and tasks; lose points upon death.
